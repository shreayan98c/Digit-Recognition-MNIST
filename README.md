# Digit-Recognition-MNIST
Objective is to train the system to first understand what are handwritten images of digits an then test the system to predict new handwritten images correctly. We will feed our system with MNIST dataset and test it with random images to check the accuracy of its predictions.

Languages Used: Python

Dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

It is a data-set, consisting images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is a monochrome , 28 * 28 pixel.
